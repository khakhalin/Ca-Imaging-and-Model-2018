Comments on how data is stored
============

# Original dataset

For each experiment, we have the following set of data files:

1.	Excel file with fluorescence signals
2.	TIFF containing ROIs â€“ Not necessary, as ROI (x,y) coordinates are also stored in same Excel data file.
3.	A print-screen of ROIs (for further processing in imageJ)
4.	.mat file with a Matlab structure (S) containing all data from this Excel file, and also spikes reconstructed
