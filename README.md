Paper: Calcium Imaging and Developmental Model
==============================================

Working title: Graph analysis of a collision detection network in the tectum, and its replication in a simple computational model

## About

A *very draft* version of the paper [can be seen here, as LaTeX document](https://github.com/khakhalin/Ca-img-2018-tex/blob/master/main.tex)

## Workflow

* [All programs and scripts involved in this study](Description_programs.md) - a comprehensive, well commented list, with a full description of analytic workflow. Because the project took 5 years, the final workflow looks rather messy, and the naming of files got rather haphazard, making this document absolutely necessary.
* [Some comments on data formats](Description_data.md) - for now very minimal, but I plan to describe it better in the future.
* [Misc comments on early stages of processing](Description_misc.md) - other miscellaneous comments that were scattered in various documents, and that I'm now trying to gather ans bring in order.
