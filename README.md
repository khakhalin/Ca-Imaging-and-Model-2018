Working title: Graph analysis of a collision detection network in the tectum, and its replication in a simple computational model
==============================================

## Draft Abstract

Looming is one of the most salient visual stimuli an animal may encounter, yet mechanisms of looming detection in vertebrates are poorly understood. For many animals, key computations involved in looming detection and collision avoidance seem to be performed by distributed networks, making it hard to tease out their underlying mechanisms. In this study, we contrast a computational developmental model of the optic tectum with the analysis of directed connectivity graphs, reconstructed from high-speed calcium imaging recording in Xenopus tadpoles. We report a difference in graph properties of tectal networks reconstructed from younger and older tadpoles, with degree distributions and network modularity changing in development. We also describe that in tadpoles, looming-selective cells tended to receive more inputs, and had higher Katz centrality than non-selective cells. We compare these results to predictions of a model governed by spike-time-dependent plasticity, homeostatic intrinsic plasticity, synaptic competition, and driven by structured visual inputs. We show that under general conditions, our model network developed robust looming selectivity, and replicated some changes in network properties observed in imaging experiments, including increase in modularity and changes in degree distributions. Other changes predicted by the model (hierarchy, efficiency, and spatial distribution of selective cells) were however not observed in imaging experiments. Finally, by comparing several alternative models, we show which developmental rules may be most critical for the development of looming selectivity.

## Workflow

* [All programs and scripts involved in this study](/Documentation/Description_programs.md) - a comprehensive, well commented list, with a full description of analytic workflow. Because the project took 5 years, the final workflow looks rather messy, and the naming of files got rather haphazard, making this document absolutely necessary.
