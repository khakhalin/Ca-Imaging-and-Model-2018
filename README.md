## About

_in progress_

## Workflow

* [All programs and scripts involved in this study](Description_programs.md) - a comprehensive list, with insightful comments, and a full description of analytic workflow. Because the project took 5 years, it is a bit of a mess, and the naming of files if very far from ideal, so this long list proved absolutely necessary.
* [Some comments on data formats](Description_data.md) - for now very minimal, but I'll probably have to describe it better in the future.
* [Misc comments on early stages of processing](Description_misc.md) - other miscellaneous comments that were scattered in various documents, and that I'm now trying to bring in some semblance of order.
